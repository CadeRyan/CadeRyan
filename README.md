### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cade and I'm a software engineer, maker and coffee enthusiast. People seem to like me because I am polite and I am rarely late.

Feel free to check out my website [cade.ie](https://www.cade.ie) if you'd like to contact me or learn additional things about me I guess.
